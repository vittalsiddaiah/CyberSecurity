Your objective is simple: Criminal Activities
Your motive is a little bit more complex: Madness

Stage One:

To begin your plan, you must first Seduce a Wealthy Heiress. This will cause the world to sit up and take notice, stunned by your arrival. Who is this Despoiler of all that is Good and Nice and True? Where did they come from? And why do they look so good as a Brain in a Jar?

Stage Two:

Next, you will Contaminate/poison the Town's Water Supply. This will cause countless hordes of the Religious Right to flock to you, begging to do your every bidding. Your name will become synonymous with Sheer dementedness, as lesser men whisper your name in terror.

Stage Three:

Finally, you will Reveal to the World your Needlessly Big Weather Machine, bringing about Something That's Really Metal. This will all be done from a Warehouse, an excellent choice if we might say. These three deeds will herald the end, and the citizens of this planet will have no choice but to elect you their new god.

Trust us, it'll all come together in the end.
